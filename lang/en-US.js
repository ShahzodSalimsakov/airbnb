We want to make sure you have everything you need to get off to a great start. Most cities have rules covering home sharing, and the specific codes and ordinances can appear in many places (such as zoning, building, licensing or tax codes). In most places, you must register, get a permit, or obtain a licence before you list your property or accept guests. You may also be responsible for collecting and remitting certain taxes. In some places, short-term rentals could be prohibited altogether. Since you are responsible for your own decision to list, you should get comfortable with the applicable rules before listing on Airbnb. To get you started, we offer some helpful resources under "Your City Laws".',
